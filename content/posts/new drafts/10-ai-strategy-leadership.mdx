AI isn't a technology issue—it's a leadership issue. Previous edtech automated tasks; AI performs cognitive work (writing, analyzing, evaluating, creating). When a student uses AI to write an essay, that's a question about learning, integrity, and the purpose of education—not network infrastructure. Delegating AI strategy to IT ensures that the people making decisions don't have the educational context to make them well. Here's what visible AI leadership looks like.

{/* [INPUT NEEDED: Do you have an "aha moment" when you realized AI wasn't an IT issue? What triggered that realization?] */}

## Why Is AI Different From Previous EdTech?

AI isn't a faster computer or better projector. It performs cognitive work—the kind traditionally considered uniquely human:

| Previous EdTech | AI |
|----------------|-----|
| Automated tasks | Performs cognitive work |
| Faster information access | Writes, analyzes, evaluates, creates |
| Tools for presentation | Reasons and generates |
| Questions about efficiency | Questions about learning, integrity, purpose |

When a student asks AI to write their essay, that's not a technology question. It's about learning, integrity, skill development, and education's purpose.

When a teacher uses AI for feedback, that's not a technology question. It's about human relationships in education, the nature of evaluation, and what we value in teaching.

These questions don't belong to IT. They belong to educational leaders.

<Callout type="warning" title="The delegation trap">
Delegating AI to IT treats it as operational rather than strategic. It signals that AI is about tools, not teaching. It ensures decisions are made without educational context.
</Callout>

## What Decisions Can Only Leaders Make?

Some AI decisions are technical (which tools to adopt, data security, infrastructure). IT can handle these.

But the most important decisions are philosophical and pedagogical:

| Decision | Why It's Not Technical |
|----------|----------------------|
| **What's your educational philosophy about AI?** | Shapes whether AI is tool, threat, or transformation |
| **Where's the line between efficiency and learning?** | Some productive struggle is essential—deciding which inefficiencies to preserve is educational judgment |
| **What expectations will you communicate to families?** | Parents want to understand your approach; IT can't speak for educational values |
| **How will you respond to integrity violations?** | Involves philosophy, development, relationships, institutional values |
| **Where will you invest limited resources?** | Prioritization is a leadership function |

There's no right answer to "Is AI a tool to enhance human capability or a shortcut that undermines skill development?"—but there needs to be an answer, and it shapes everything else.

## What Does Visible AI Leadership Look Like?

Visible AI leadership isn't about being an AI expert. It's about being present, engaged, and clearly the person making decisions.

**Use AI yourself.** You can't lead an AI strategy you don't understand. Experiment with tools. Feel what they can and can't do. Experience the temptations and frustrations your teachers and students face.

**Be present for AI discussions.** When teachers discuss AI challenges, be there—not to dictate, but to understand. When parents raise concerns, engage directly. Presence signals priority.

**Share your learning publicly.** Model the learning stance you want from others. "I've been experimenting with AI and here's what I'm discovering" is more powerful than pronouncements from on high.

**Make decisions visibly.** When you make choices about AI—approving tools, setting expectations, responding to incidents—be clear that you're making them. Own the decisions. Explain your reasoning.

**Invite challenge.** The AI landscape is uncertain. "I think X, but I'm not sure—tell me why I'm wrong" creates productive dialogue. Certainty is false comfort.

## How Do You Build AI Fluency as a Leader?

You don't need to be an expert, but you need enough fluency to lead:

**Use AI tools weekly.** Not to become an expert—to develop intuition. Use them for your own work: drafting communications, summarizing documents, exploring ideas.

**Read selectively, not exhaustively.** AI news is overwhelming. Find 2-3 trusted sources and follow them. You need to stay current, not comprehensive.

**Talk to your teachers.** The people using AI daily in your context know things you don't. Ask what's working, what's not, what they're struggling with.

**Connect with peers.** Other school leaders face the same challenges. Conversations about what they're trying, what's working, what's failing are invaluable.

**Accept uncertainty.** Nobody has figured this out. The leaders who navigate AI best are comfortable with uncertainty, willing to experiment, and prepared to adjust.

<Callout type="tip" title="The fluency threshold">
You need enough AI fluency to ask good questions, not enough to have all answers. Can you evaluate whether a proposed AI tool makes educational sense? Can you understand why a teacher is excited or concerned? That's the threshold.
</Callout>

## What's the Cost of Leadership Absence?

When school leaders delegate AI to IT and step back:

**Policies reflect technical thinking, not educational thinking.** They focus on what's possible rather than what's pedagogically sound.

**Teachers feel unsupported.** They navigate complex questions without visible leadership guidance.

**Parents get mixed messages.** Different parts of the school communicate differently because there's no unified voice.

**Decisions get made by default rather than design.** The absence of strategy is still a strategy—just a bad one.

AI is reshaping education. That process will be navigated well or poorly. The difference depends largely on whether educational leaders lead—or delegate to others what only they can do.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I'm not tech-savvy?

You don't need to be. AI leadership is about educational judgment, not technical expertise. Can you evaluate whether something serves learning? Can you articulate what you value in education? Those are the skills that matter. Technical questions can be delegated; philosophical ones can't.

### How do I start if I've never used AI tools?

Start with one tool for one purpose. Many leaders begin with email drafting or meeting summarization—low-stakes uses that provide immediate value. Spend 30 minutes experimenting. Then try another use case. Fluency builds through regular practice, not intensive study.

### What if my IT department has more AI expertise than I do?

Good—leverage their technical expertise while retaining educational decision-making. The best approach: IT advises on technical feasibility, security, and implementation; leadership decides on educational appropriateness, policy, and values. Expertise in different domains should complement, not compete.

### How do I communicate about AI when I'm still figuring it out?

Honestly. "Here's what we're learning, here's what we've decided so far, and here's what we're still working through" is credible and builds trust. Parents and teachers respect leaders who acknowledge uncertainty while actively engaging with challenges.

### Should I form an AI committee?

Maybe—but don't use it to avoid leadership. Committees can gather input, pilot tools, and develop recommendations. But the Head of School should be visibly involved in key decisions, not receiving reports from a distance. A committee that replaces leadership engagement is a delegation trap with extra steps.
