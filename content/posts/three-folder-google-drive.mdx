## The Shared Drive Graveyard

Every school has one. The shared Google Drive that looks like an archaeological dig.

Folders named "Old," "Old_Archive," "DO NOT USE," and "Curriculum_Final_FINAL_v2." You spend ten minutes hunting for the budget template, only to find three versions with no way to tell which one is current.

This costs more than frustration.

Knowledge workers spend an average of 8.8 hours per week searching for and gathering information—nearly a fifth of the workweek lost to digital archaeology ([McKinsey Global Institute, 2012](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy)). For school leaders juggling operational urgency and strategic demands, those are hours stolen from the work that matters.

The common diagnosis is "we need to get organized." The actual problem runs deeper: most people organize by **Topic**.

Math. HR. Events. Curriculum.

Topics overlap. Does the "Math Fair Budget" go in "Math," "Events," or "Finance"? Wherever you put it, you'll search the wrong place six months later.

## Organizing by Time Instead

I run my entire professional life—schools, consulting projects, personal assets—out of exactly three root folders.

{/* [VISUAL SPEC: Screenshot of a Google Drive folder named '00_KAIAK_DEMO' containing exactly three subfolders: 01_ACTIVE, 02_LIBRARY, 03_ARCHIVE. Clean view, no other clutter. Crop tight to show just these three folders.] */}

The organizing principle isn't subject matter. It's time horizon.

### 01_ACTIVE — The Workbench

**Rule:** Only projects that are moving *right now* belong here. If I haven't touched it in 30 days, it doesn't belong.

**Contents:**
- "Q3 Board Report"
- "Hiring Spring 2026"
- "Accreditation Visit"
- "Client Project: Smith Academy"

**Effect:** When I open Drive, I see my priorities. Not the handbook from 2019. Not last year's enrollment projections. The work.

Research on attention and cognitive load shows that visual clutter competes for neural resources, reducing our ability to focus ([Lavie et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1037/0096-3445.133.3.339)). A clean workbench isn't aesthetic preference—it's a performance decision.

### 02_LIBRARY — The Reference Shelf

**Rule:** Valid, finalized documents I need to reference but not change. The source of truth.

**Contents:**
- "Brand Assets" (logos, slide templates)
- "Policy Manuals" (the official PDF, not drafts)
- "Standard Operating Procedures"
- "Legal Contracts"

**Effect:** If it's in the Library, I know it's current. No more wondering if I'm using an outdated logo or policy.

<Callout type="tip" title="Read-only in spirit">
If you need to edit something from the Library, copy it to ACTIVE first. When finalized, the new version replaces the old one in the Library.
</Callout>

I've written about this "cathedral vs. kitchen" distinction in my post on [Notion as a second brain](/blog/notion-cathedral-kitchen). The Library is cathedral space—clean, permanent, finished. Active is kitchen space—messy, in-progress, evolving.

### 03_ARCHIVE — The Graveyard

**Rule:** Everything else. Organized by Year or by closed Project.

**Contents:**
- "2024 Budget Drafts"
- "Old Curriculum Maps"
- "Completed Client Projects"

**Effect:** We hoard files because deleting feels risky. "What if I need that email draft from three years ago?"

The Archive lets you hoard without cluttering your workbench. Dump it there. You'll likely never open it again, but you'll feel safe knowing you could.

{/* [VISUAL SPEC: Screenshot showing the inside of an 03_ARCHIVE folder with year-based subfolders (2023-2024, 2022-2023, etc.) Clean organization by time period.] */}

## Monthly Maintenance: 15 Minutes

A system without maintenance becomes entropy.

I have a recurring calendar event for the last Friday of every month: **"Digital Housekeeping."**

Fifteen minutes. Three steps.

**Step 1:** Review 01_ACTIVE. Is "Fall Hiring" done? Drag it to 03_ARCHIVE.

**Step 2:** Check for finalizations. Did we approve the "New Assessment Policy"? Drag the final PDF to 02_LIBRARY. Drafts go to 03_ARCHIVE.

**Step 3:** Quick scan. Anything in ACTIVE I haven't touched in 30+ days? Probably doesn't belong there.

Done. The workbench stays clean.

<Callout type="warning" title="Schedule it or lose it">
Don't organize during the workday. "I'll clean up my Drive when I have time" means "never." Treat digital maintenance like report cards—it goes on the calendar.
</Callout>

This connects to the broader principle in my [Inbox Zero approach](/blog/no-admin-inbox-zero): maintenance isn't extra work. It's the work that prevents extra work.

## The Speed Layer: AI Retrieval

Structure handles *storage*. For *retrieval*, I don't browse folders anymore.

I connect my 02_LIBRARY folder to NotebookLM. Instead of clicking through subfolders to find the Cell Phone Policy, I ask: *"What's the policy on 9th graders having phones?"*

{/* [VISUAL SPEC: Screenshot of NotebookLM interface showing a query about school policy and the AI response with citation to the source document. Show the clean interface and the document citation.] */}

The AI gives me the answer and cites the source document. Folder structure keeps the AI grounded in accurate, current documents. The AI keeps me fast.

This is what I mean by [building systems that work while you sleep](/blog/five-systems-every-new-head-needs). Time invested in structure pays dividends every time you search.

## Why One Decision Beats Many

Most folder systems fail because they demand decisions about *categories*.

"Is this a Finance document or an HR document?" That's a decision. Decisions require cognitive effort. When you're rushing between meetings, you'll dump the file somewhere random—or worse, in the root directory—and the system collapses.

The 3-Folder system requires one decision: **Is this project active?**

- Yes → 01_ACTIVE
- No, but I might reference it → 02_LIBRARY
- No, and it's done → 03_ARCHIVE

One decision. No category debates. No ambiguity.

## Implementation

You don't need a weekend. You need 30 minutes.

**Week one:**
- Create three folders: 01_ACTIVE, 02_LIBRARY, 03_ARCHIVE
- Move everything currently in progress into ACTIVE
- Don't touch anything else yet

**Month one:**
- Add "Digital Housekeeping" to your calendar (last Friday of every month)
- During that first session, move obvious archive material out of your root

**Quarter one:**
- Audit LIBRARY—is everything there actually current?
- Connect LIBRARY to an AI tool for fast retrieval

Target outcome: Find anything in under 60 seconds.

## Beyond the Drive

Your Drive isn't just storage. It reflects how you think about time.

Organizing by topic means thinking in static, overlapping categories. Organizing by time horizon means thinking in priorities—what's live, what's finished, what's reference.

That mental shift extends beyond file storage. It's how I structure my [entire second brain](/blog/notion-cathedral-kitchen), my email, and my calendar.

The 3-Folder system works because it's really a mental model wearing a folder structure.
