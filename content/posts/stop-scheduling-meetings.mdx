## The Meeting About the Meeting

**The pattern:** Someone sends a meeting invite titled "Discuss curriculum changes." You attend. Forty-five minutes later, the only decision made is that you need another meeting to actually discuss the curriculum changes - once you've gathered more information.

That first meeting wasn't a meeting. It was expensive email.

**The meta-problem:** Schools and organizations don't have too many meetings. They have too many meetings that *don't make decisions*. And those create more meetings.

---

## Why This Keeps Happening

**The culprits:**

**1. Unclear meeting purpose**

"Discuss X" is not a purpose. A purpose is: "Decide between option A and B." Or: "Identify what information we need to decide between A and B."

If your meeting invite doesn't include the word "decide," "finalize," or "commit" - it might not need to be synchronous.

**2. Missing pre-work**

Meetings should be where thinking *converges*, not where it starts. When people show up without shared context, you spend the first 30 minutes getting everyone to the same starting line.

**3. The wrong people in the room**

Decision meetings need decision-makers. Information-gathering meetings need informers. Most meetings mush these together and nobody knows what role they're playing.

<Callout type="warning" title="The expensive question">
At a school, a one-hour meeting with 6 people costs roughly $300-500 in salary time. How many of those hours are generating $300 worth of decisions?

## The Async Decision Template

**Before scheduling a meeting, try this:**

```markdown
## Decision Needed
[One sentence: what are we deciding?]

## Background
[2-3 sentences max - link to documents for more]

## Options
Option A: [description]
- Pro: 
- Con:

Option B: [description]
- Pro:
- Con:

## My Recommendation
[Which option and why]

## What I Need From You
- [ ] Agree and we proceed
- [ ] Disagree and suggest alternative
- [ ] Need clarification on [specific question]

## Timeline
Decision needed by: [date]
If no response by [date], I'll proceed with my recommendation.
```

**What this does:**

- Forces clarity about what's actually being decided
- Gives people time to think before reacting
- Creates a paper trail of reasoning
- Sets a clear deadline
- Eliminates the meeting if everyone agrees

**How often this works:** About 60% of "discussions" can be resolved asynchronously once you frame them properly.

---

## When You Actually Need to Meet

**Legitimate meeting purposes:**

- **Conflict resolution** - When two people have opposing views and need to hash it out in real-time
- **Relationship building** - New team member, new stakeholder, repair needed
- **Complex coordination** - Multiple dependencies that need simultaneous alignment
- **Creative generativity** - Actual brainstorming (rare)
- **Sensitive communication** - Delivering difficult news

**Notice what's NOT on this list:**
- Status updates (use a shared document)
- Information sharing (use Loom or email)
- "Getting everyone on the same page" (that's what async documentation is for)

## The Meeting Audit

**Pull up your calendar from last week. For each meeting:**

1. Was there a clear decision to be made?
2. Was that decision actually made?
3. Could the outcome have been achieved asynchronously?

<BeforeAfter 
  before="8 meetings this week, 2 decisions made"
  after="3 meetings this week, 3 decisions made"
  context="Fewer meetings, each with a clear purpose"
/>

**The uncomfortable truth:** Most recurring meetings exist because they were set up once and nobody has the courage to question them. "We've always had a Monday leadership team meeting" isn't a reason.

---

## The Pre-Read Protocol

**For meetings that genuinely need to happen:**

**48 hours before the meeting:**
- Circulate all relevant context documents
- Share the decision template above
- Ask participants to come with their position, not their questions

**At the meeting:**
- Skip the summary (everyone read the pre-read, right?)
- Go straight to positions and disagreements
- Make the decision
- Document it before leaving

**The rule:** If the pre-work isn't done, cancel the meeting. Don't reward people for not preparing by summarizing it for them.

<Callout type="tip" title="The 'No Agenda, No Attend' Policy">
Some teams adopt a strict policy: if a meeting invite doesn't include a clear agenda with decision points, recipients are free to decline. It sounds harsh until you realize how much time it saves.
</Callout>

## The Standing Meeting Problem

**The most dangerous meetings are recurring ones.**

They perpetuate regardless of whether there's anything to discuss. People show up, someone fills the time, an hour disappears.

**Fix options:**

1. **Make them opt-in:** Post an agenda 24 hours ahead. If there's nothing substantive, cancel.

2. **Shorten them:** Try 25 minutes instead of 60. See if the same work gets done.

3. **Change the frequency:** Weekly becomes biweekly. Most things don't change that fast.

4. **Kill them entirely:** Replace with async updates and schedule ad-hoc when truly needed.

## The Real Issue

<RelatedPost

  title="The Difference Between Running a School and Being Run By One"
  context="Meetings are a symptom of a bigger problem →"
/>

Too many meetings usually indicate:
- Unclear decision rights (people don't know who can decide what)
- Low trust (need to "be seen" participating)
- Avoidance (meetings feel productive without requiring actual output)

**Fixing your meeting culture requires addressing these root causes.** The templates and tactics help, but they're treating symptoms if you don't also clarify who decides what and create safety for asynchronous work.

## Start Here

**This week:**

1. Pick one recurring meeting
2. Send the async decision template instead
3. See if the meeting becomes unnecessary

<TimeSaved hours={4} task="pre-meetings and unfocused discussions" frequency="per week" />

Every meeting you eliminate creates space for something that actually requires your presence.
