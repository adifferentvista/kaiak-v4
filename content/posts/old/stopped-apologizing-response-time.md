For years, half my emails started the same way:

"Sorry for the delayed response..."
"Apologies for the late reply..."
"I'm so sorry this took so long..."

I thought I was being polite. I was actually undermining myself.

Here's what I learned when I stopped apologizing for response time — and what happened next.

## What I Was Really Saying

When you apologize for response time, you're communicating several things:

**"Your timeline is more important than mine."** You're accepting that their expectation (immediate response) is valid and your behavior (responding when you could) is wrong.

**"I'm behind."** Every apology reinforces the narrative that you're overwhelmed, disorganized, or can't keep up.

**"I owe you faster."** You're implicitly promising to do better next time — a promise you probably can't keep, which sets you up for more apologies.

**"This email is already starting from a deficit."** Before you've said anything substantive, you've framed yourself as the person who let them down.

None of these are messages I want to send. But I was sending them dozens of times a week.

## The Expectation Myth

Here's the thing: most people don't actually expect instant responses.

When I asked colleagues and parents what response time they expected from me, the answers surprised me:
- Staff expected responses within 24-48 hours
- Parents expected responses within 48 hours
- Board members expected responses within a few days unless urgent

Nobody said "immediately." The urgency was in my head.

What creates the perception of expectation:
- Seeing that someone sent an email hours ago and feeling guilty
- Remembering the one time someone complained about slow response
- Assuming that others share our own anxiety about inbox zero

The expectation for instant response is largely a story we tell ourselves.

## What I Do Instead

I replaced apologies with three alternatives:

### Alternative 1: Just answer

Most of the time, I just answer the email. No preamble. No acknowledgment of time passed.

They asked a question. I answered it. That's what they wanted. They don't need my feelings about how long it took.

Example:
- ~~"Sorry for the delay! The answer is yes, we can adjust the schedule."~~
- "Yes, we can adjust the schedule. Here's what I'd suggest..."

### Alternative 2: Thank them

If I want to acknowledge the wait, I thank them instead of apologizing.

"Thanks for your patience" accomplishes the same social function as an apology without the self-deprecation.

Example:
- ~~"Sorry it took me a while to get back to you on this."~~
- "Thanks for your patience on this. Here's what I found out..."

The shift from "sorry" to "thanks" changes who's doing whom a favor. You're thanking them for being reasonable, not apologizing for being slow.

### Alternative 3: Acknowledge and move on

For genuinely long delays (a week or more), I briefly acknowledge it without groveling.

"I'm getting back to you on [topic]" acknowledges there was a gap without making it a big deal.

Example:
- ~~"I'm so sorry it's taken me forever to respond to this. I know you sent it ages ago and I feel terrible."~~
- "Getting back to you on the facilities question — here's my thinking..."

## The Exceptions

There are times when a real apology is warranted:

**If the delay caused actual harm.** If someone missed a deadline or opportunity because you didn't respond in time, that deserves acknowledgment.

**If you made a specific commitment.** If you said "I'll get back to you by Friday" and it's now Wednesday of the next week, own it.

**If the relationship calls for it.** With certain people (a board chair, a key parent), the relationship might require more explicit acknowledgment.

But these are exceptions. The default should be responding without apology.

## What Happened When I Stopped

I expected pushback. I thought people would think I was rude or uncaring.

Here's what actually happened: nothing.

Nobody commented on the lack of apology. Nobody seemed to notice. The emails were just... emails.

What did change:

**My emails got shorter.** Without a preamble of apologies, I got to the point faster. People probably appreciated that more than my contrition.

**I felt less guilty.** The constant apologizing was reinforcing my own sense of being behind. Without it, my inbox felt less like a source of shame.

**I modeled something different.** After I stopped apologizing, I noticed some of my team members stopped too. We were collectively stepping off the hamster wheel of performative guilt.

## The Deeper Pattern

The email apology is part of a larger pattern: over-apologizing as a leadership style.

I used to apologize for:
- Asking people to do their jobs
- Setting boundaries
- Making decisions people disagreed with
- Taking time to think before answering
- Not being available 24/7

Each apology felt like politeness. Cumulatively, they communicated uncertainty and weakness.

I'm not saying leaders should never apologize. Genuine apologies for real mistakes are important. But reflexive apologizing — apologizing for existing, for having needs, for not being perfect — that erodes authority.

## The Response Time Conversation

If response time is actually a problem in your organization, address it directly instead of through apologies.

Set explicit expectations:
- "I check email three times a day. If something is urgent, text me."
- "I respond to parent emails within 48 hours. Urgent safety issues get same-day response."
- "I'm slow on email but fast on Slack."

When you set expectations explicitly, you can meet them without guilt. And you're not implicitly promising something you can't deliver.

## How to Make the Shift

If you're a chronic apologizer, here's how to change:

**Notice it.** For one week, put a tally mark every time you apologize in an email. Just awareness changes behavior.

**Pause before sending.** Before you hit send, scan for "sorry" and "apologize." Delete them. See if the email still works. (It usually does.)

**Replace with thanks.** If you feel like you need something, swap "sorry for the delay" with "thanks for your patience."

**Remind yourself of reality.** When guilt creeps in, remember: most people aren't timing your responses. The urgency is usually in your head.

**Give yourself permission.** You're allowed to respond to emails when you can respond to emails. That's not a character flaw.

## The Message You Want to Send

Here's what I want to communicate now:

"I'm a thoughtful leader with a lot of demands on my time. I prioritize carefully. I respond to things when I can give them proper attention. That's a feature, not a bug."

That message is incompatible with constant apologizing.

The email apology feels small. But language shapes reality. Every time you apologize for response time, you're telling yourself — and others — a story about who you are.

Choose a different story.
