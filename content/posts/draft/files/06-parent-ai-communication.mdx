The email came on a Sunday evening, as parent emails often do.

"I just found out my daughter has been using ChatGPT for homework. Is that allowed? How do I know she's actually learning? What is the school's policy on this? I'm worried she's not developing real skills."

Four questions, one email, and underneath them all: fear that her child is being left behind or cheating her way through, and frustration that nobody told her what the rules were.

This parent isn't unusual. She's every parent right now.

## The Five Questions Parents Are Really Asking

When parents raise concerns about AI, they're usually circling around five core questions—even if they don't phrase them this directly.

**1. "What are the rules?"**
Parents want to know what's allowed and what isn't. They want clear boundaries they can reinforce at home. When schools don't communicate policies, parents either assume everything is forbidden or that anything goes.

**2. "How do you catch cheating?"**
This reveals anxiety about fairness. Parents worry their honest child will be disadvantaged compared to kids who cut corners. They want assurance that integrity matters and is enforced.

**3. "Is my child actually learning or just taking shortcuts?"**
This is the deeper fear. Parents understand that AI can produce impressive outputs. They worry that outputs no longer reflect understanding—that their child might graduate with credentials but without capabilities.

**4. "What are you teaching about AI?"**
Parents recognize that AI skills matter for the future. They want to know the school is preparing students for an AI-integrated world, not just policing against misuse.

**5. "Should I be worried?"**
Sometimes this is the only question. They've read headlines about AI disrupting education. They don't know what to think. They want reassurance—or at least honest guidance.

<Callout type="tip" title="Listen for the fear">
Behind every question is usually a fear. Identify the fear and you can address what the parent actually needs to hear. "What's your AI policy?" might really mean "I'm afraid my child is cheating and I don't know what to do about it."

## The Fears Behind the Questions

Understanding what parents are afraid of helps you respond more effectively.

**Fear of unfairness.** Their child follows the rules while others cheat. The honest kid gets lower grades. The system rewards deception.

**Fear of skill gaps.** Their child uses AI as a crutch and doesn't develop real capabilities. They graduate unable to write, think, or problem-solve without AI assistance.

**Fear of being out of the loop.** Everyone else knows what's happening except them. Their child is using tools they don't understand. They can't help or monitor effectively.

**Fear of schools being behind.** The world is changing fast. Schools are slow. Their child is being prepared for a world that no longer exists.

## Sample Response Language

Here's how you might address each core question:

**On rules:** "We expect students to be transparent about AI use, to use it purposefully rather than as a substitute for thinking, and to develop foundational skills before leveraging AI to enhance them. Specific expectations vary by assignment and are communicated by teachers. If you're ever unsure what's allowed, ask—we'd rather have the conversation than have uncertainty."

**On integrity:** "We've shifted from trying to detect AI use to designing assignments where authentic engagement is visible. We require process documentation, incorporate in-class components, and design tasks that connect to personal and local context that AI can't access. This doesn't catch every violation, but it makes cheating harder and learning more visible."

**On learning:** "We share your concern about students developing real skills. That's why we design assignments that require students to demonstrate understanding, not just produce outputs. We look for thinking, not just answers. If you're concerned about your specific child, let's look together at what they can do independently."

**On AI education:** "We're teaching students to use AI as a tool—how to prompt effectively, how to evaluate outputs, how to verify information, and how to know when AI is and isn't appropriate. These skills matter for their future, and hiding from AI won't serve them well."

**On whether to worry:** "AI is changing how we work and learn. That's real. But the fundamentals haven't changed: reading carefully, thinking critically, communicating clearly, and collaborating effectively still matter—maybe more than ever. We're adapting our approach while keeping focus on what matters most."

## Proactive Communication Beats Reactive Damage Control

Don't wait for worried emails. Get ahead of them.

**At the start of the year:** Share your AI philosophy and policy. Explain your reasoning. Invite questions. A single proactive communication prevents dozens of reactive ones.

**Regularly through the year:** Brief updates in newsletters or parent communications. "Here's what we're learning about AI in education." "Here's how we're adapting." Transparency builds trust.

**When something goes wrong:** Don't hide it. Parents respect honesty more than perfection. "We had an incident, here's how we handled it, here's what we learned" builds credibility.

**Through parent education opportunities:** Offer sessions on what AI tools students are using, how to have conversations about AI at home, and how to recognize productive versus problematic use. Parents who understand the landscape become partners.

<Callout type="warning" title="The trust cost of silence">
When schools don't communicate about AI, parents fill the vacuum with anxiety. Assumptions grow. Trust erodes. A few minutes of proactive communication saves hours of damage control.

## What Parents Can Do at Home

End conversations with parents by empowering them. Suggest:

**Ask about AI use openly.** "Did you use any AI tools for this? How?" makes AI visible rather than hidden. Curiosity works better than accusation.

**Discuss assignments together.** "What are you supposed to be learning here? How would AI help or hurt that?" builds metacognition about purposeful use.

**Model thoughtful AI use.** Use AI tools yourself and talk about it. When you verify an AI response or choose not to use AI for something, explain why.

**Stay curious, not panicked.** AI isn't inherently good or bad. The question is how it's used. Approach it as a learning journey for the family.
