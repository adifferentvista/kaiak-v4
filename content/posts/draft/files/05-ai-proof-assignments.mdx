Banning AI on assignments is like banning calculators when every student has a smartphone in their pocket. You can make the rule, but you can't enforce it—and the attempt creates adversarial dynamics that undermine learning.

The better question isn't "How do I prevent AI use?" It's "How do I design assignments where authentic engagement is more rewarding than shortcuts?"

Turns out, the assignments that resist AI shortcuts are often better assignments anyway—more engaging, more meaningful, more likely to produce genuine learning.

## What Makes Assignments Vulnerable

Generic assignments are AI's sweet spot. "Write a five-paragraph essay about the themes of the novel." "Create a presentation on the causes of World War I." "Analyze the symbolism in this poem." AI can produce competent responses to all of these in seconds.

The vulnerability comes from several factors. **Predictable formats** that AI has seen thousands of times. **Topics covered extensively online** where AI has abundant training data. **No connection to specific context** that AI can't access. **Product-only evaluation** where the final output is all that matters.

When an assignment has all of these characteristics, you've essentially designed a task optimized for AI completion.

## Five Principles for AI-Resistant Design

**1. Require process, not just product.**

When you only see the final essay, you can't tell how it was created. When you see brainstorming notes, rough drafts, revision history, and reflection on changes made, the process becomes visible.

This doesn't mean micromanaging every step. It means building in checkpoints that make thinking visible. A first draft submitted before AI feedback is allowed. A reflection explaining which suggestions were accepted and why. An in-class component that can't be outsourced.

**2. Connect to local, recent, or personal context.**

AI can write about the Civil War in general. It can't write about the conversation you had with your grandmother about her experience of segregation. It can't analyze the city council meeting that happened last Tuesday. It can't incorporate the class discussion from yesterday.

Assignments grounded in specific, recent, local, or personal context require engagement that AI can't provide.

<BeforeAfter 
  before="Analyze the economic impact of urbanization"
  after="Interview someone who moved from a rural area to a city. Compare their experience to what researchers have found about urbanization's economic effects."
/>

**3. Include in-class components.**

A timed, in-class writing sample establishes what the student can produce independently. Oral defenses require students to explain and extend their written work. Collaborative in-class activities generate shared context that individual AI use can't replicate.

You don't need to make everything in-class. But including some component that happens in your presence provides a reference point and reduces the incentive to outsource the rest.

**4. Make AI use explicit and bounded.**

Rather than prohibiting AI, specify how it should and shouldn't be used. "Use AI to brainstorm topics, but write your thesis yourself." "After completing your first draft, use AI to identify weaknesses—then document which suggestions you accepted and why."

When AI use is explicit, it becomes a tool rather than a cheat. Students learn to work with AI productively instead of hiding it.

**5. Design for iteration.**

A single submission incentivizes getting the "right answer" by any means. Multiple drafts with feedback cycles incentivize learning. When students know they'll revise based on feedback, the first attempt matters less than the learning trajectory.

Iteration also makes AI assistance more visible. A student who suddenly improves dramatically between drafts raises natural questions.

## Subject-Specific Examples

**English/Language Arts:** Instead of "Write an essay on the American Dream in literature," try: "Interview a family member about their definition of success. Compare their perspective to how success is portrayed in [novel]. Where do they align? Where do they differ?"

**Science:** Instead of "Explain the scientific method," try: "Design an experiment to test a question you have about something in our school. Submit your hypothesis, method, and expected results. You'll conduct a simplified version in class."

**Social Studies:** Instead of "Describe the causes of [historical event]," try: "Find a primary source from our local historical society related to [period]. What does it reveal that general histories don't include?"

**Math:** Instead of problem sets alone, try: "Solve these problems, then create a video explaining your process for the two you found most challenging. Your explanation should help a classmate who's stuck."

Assignments designed to resist AI shortcuts tend to be more engaging assignments. Students report preferring work that connects to their lives over generic academic tasks. You're not just preventing cheating—you're improving learning.

## The IB Connection

For schools implementing IB programs, these principles align naturally with IB philosophy. The emphasis on inquiry, personal engagement, and demonstration of understanding over content reproduction maps directly to AI-resistant design.

ATL skills become more important, not less, in an AI environment. Critical thinking, self-management, and communication can't be outsourced. Assignments that develop these skills are inherently more resistant to AI shortcuts.

## Start Small

You don't need to redesign every assignment. Start with one—ideally one where you suspect AI use is already happening—and apply these principles.

The goal isn't to make cheating impossible. It's to make authentic engagement the easier path. When the assignment is personally meaningful, locally grounded, and requires visible process, most students will choose genuine work over elaborate workarounds.
