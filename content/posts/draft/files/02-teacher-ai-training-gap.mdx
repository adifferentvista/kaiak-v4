Here's a number that should concern every school leader: 68% of urban teachers report receiving no AI training since joining their schools.

Not inadequate training. Not outdated training. None.

Meanwhile, 92% of students are using AI tools. 83% of K-12 teachers are using generative AI for personal or school-related activities. The tools are everywhere. The guidance is nowhere.

## What "No Training" Looks Like in Practice

Teachers are making it up as they go. Some ban AI entirely—then struggle to enforce it. Some ignore it—then feel blindsided when problems emerge. Some embrace it enthusiastically—then realize they've inadvertently violated data privacy policies or created academic integrity nightmares.

The 2025-2026 Education Insights Report makes this clear: while district leaders see AI as an opportunity, classroom teachers—who manage distraction, plagiarism, and unclear policies every day—approach it with more caution. There's a gap between leadership optimism and teacher reality.

That gap creates problems. Teachers who don't feel confident with AI can't teach students to use it responsibly. They can't make informed decisions about which tools to adopt. They can't have substantive conversations with parents who have questions.

<Callout type="warning" title="The confidence gap">
70% of teachers and administrators admit they don't feel ready to use AI effectively in their classrooms. Yet they're expected to guide students through a technology transformation. The math doesn't work.

## Why Traditional PD Approaches Fail for AI

Most professional development treats AI like any other tool—a one-day workshop, a slide deck, a list of approved applications. This doesn't work for three reasons.

**AI changes faster than annual training cycles.** The tool you demo in August may be obsolete by October. Training on specific applications becomes dated quickly. Teachers need frameworks for evaluating new tools, not just familiarity with current ones.

**AI requires hands-on practice, not just exposure.** You can't understand what AI can and can't do by watching a presentation. You have to use it—experiment, fail, iterate. Most PD doesn't build in this kind of exploratory time.

**AI decisions are contextual, not universal.** Whether to allow AI on a specific assignment depends on learning objectives, student needs, and assessment design. Generic policies don't help teachers make these judgment calls.

## What Effective AI Training Actually Looks Like

The research points to several principles that separate useful training from checkbox exercises.

**Ongoing over one-shot.** Instead of annual workshops, create professional learning communities where teachers meet regularly to share experiments, analyze results, and problem-solve together. A grade-level team examining how AI affected a particular assignment learns more than a whole-staff session on "AI basics."

**Practice-embedded over theory-heavy.** Teachers need to use AI for their own work—lesson planning, communication, administrative tasks—before they can guide students. Start with applications that save teachers time.

**Scenario-based over policy-based.** Rather than memorizing rules, teachers benefit from working through realistic situations. "A student submits work that reads like AI but claims it's original. What do you do?"

**Peer-led over expert-delivered.** Teachers learn well from colleagues who face the same constraints and contexts. Identify early adopters in your building and create structures for them to share what's working.

<Callout type="tip" title="The time investment that pays off">
Teachers using AI tools at least weekly save an average of 5.9 hours per week—roughly 6 extra weeks of reclaimed time across a school year. Training that helps teachers capture even half those savings pays for itself many times over.
</Callout>

## The Time Savings That Justify the Investment

HMH's annual educator survey found that 68% of teachers using AI report saving up to five hours per week. That's time reclaimed for instruction, relationship-building, or—let's be honest—not burning out.

The most impactful applications aren't the flashy ones. They're the mundane time-sinks that AI handles well: drafting parent communications, creating differentiated materials, summarizing meeting notes, generating quiz questions.

## A Realistic Path Forward

You don't need a comprehensive AI curriculum to start. You need momentum.

**This month:** Survey your teachers about their current AI use—both personal and professional. You'll likely find more experimentation happening than you knew. Identify your early adopters.

**This quarter:** Create a low-stakes space for sharing. A monthly lunch session, a shared document, a Slack channel—whatever fits your culture. Let teachers who are experimenting share what they're learning.

**This semester:** Move from informal sharing to structured practice. Pick one high-value use case—parent communication, lesson planning, or feedback on student work—and give teachers time to experiment with it.

**Ongoing:** Build AI into existing PD structures rather than treating it as a separate initiative. When you discuss assessment design, include AI considerations. Normalize AI as part of how you talk about teaching.

The goal isn't to make every teacher an AI expert. It's to build enough fluency that teachers can make informed decisions.
