A teacher mentioned to me recently that her students seem unable to start any assignment without first asking ChatGPT for ideas. "They've outsourced their thinking," she said. "They don't even try anymore."

The fear is real, and it's not irrational. If students can get answers instantly, will they develop the cognitive capabilities that come from struggling with problems themselves? Are we raising a generation that can't think without AI assistance?

The research provides a nuanced answer: it depends on how AI is used, and the design of the learning matters enormously.

## Understanding Cognitive Offloading

Cognitive offloading is when we use external tools to reduce mental demands. Writing a to-do list offloads memory. Using a calculator offloads arithmetic. Using GPS offloads navigation. These aren't inherently bad—they free up cognitive resources for higher-level thinking.

But some offloading is more problematic than others.

When you offload arithmetic to a calculator after you understand multiplication, you're using a tool to save time on something you can do. When you rely on a calculator because you never learned multiplication, you've created a dependency. The first is adaptive; the second is limiting.

AI creates unprecedented opportunities for both kinds of offloading. The question is which kind students are doing.

## What Research Shows

The evidence is mixed, which means the answer isn't "AI makes students dumber" or "AI makes students smarter"—it's more contextual than that.

**Some studies show positive effects.** The Harvard physics study found AI tutoring improved learning outcomes. Students who used AI for formative feedback showed better understanding than those who didn't. When AI is designed to guide thinking rather than replace it, it can help.

**Other studies show concerning patterns.** Research on "learned passivity" shows some students skip goal-setting, planning, and reflection when AI handles those tasks. They become passive recipients of AI outputs rather than active thinkers. Over 30% of students may develop problematic dependency patterns.

**Traditional methods often outperform AI for deep thinking.** For building critical thinking skills, sustained engagement with challenging problems—the kind that happens without AI shortcuts—remains superior. You can't offload your way to expertise.

<Callout type="warning" title="The verification problem">
66% of workers use AI outputs without verifying accuracy. If this pattern extends to students, they may be building knowledge on foundations of potential errors. Critical evaluation of AI outputs is a skill that must be taught—it doesn't develop automatically.

## When AI Helps vs. Hinders

**AI helps when:**

It guides thinking rather than replacing it. "What questions should I ask myself about this problem?" is different from "What's the answer?"

It provides feedback on student work rather than doing the work. AI identifying weaknesses in a draft prompts revision; AI writing the draft prevents learning.

It's used after foundational skills are developed. AI-enhanced writing works when you know how to write; it creates dependency when you don't.

It requires engagement rather than accepting outputs passively. Students who evaluate, modify, and build on AI outputs learn more than those who copy-paste.

**AI hinders when:**

It becomes the first step rather than a later step. Students who start every task by asking AI for ideas never develop their own idea generation.

It provides answers without explanation or struggle. The cognitive work of figuring things out is where learning happens; skipping to answers bypasses that process.

It's used before foundational skills exist. You can't enhance capabilities you haven't developed.

Students accept outputs without critical evaluation. AI confidently produces errors. Uncritical acceptance builds false confidence.

## Design Principles for Building Brains

**Skills before shortcuts.** Students need foundational capabilities before AI enhancement makes sense. You learn to write before you use AI to improve your writing. You learn to think before you use AI to extend your thinking.

**Thinking before output.** Assignments should require visible thinking processes—brainstorming, outlining, reasoning—not just final products. When thinking is visible, you can assess whether it's happening or being outsourced.

**Agency over automation.** Students should make decisions about when and how to use AI, not default to AI for everything. "I chose to use AI for X because Y" reflects agency; automatic AI use reflects dependence.

**Metacognition always.** Students should regularly reflect on their own learning: What do I understand? What am I struggling with? What would happen if I couldn't use AI? Metacognition counters learned passivity.

**Verify, don't trust.** Teach students to fact-check AI outputs, question confident claims, and compare AI responses to other sources. Healthy skepticism is essential when working with AI.

## A Practical Framework

When introducing any AI use in learning, ask:

**What cognitive work is the student doing?** If AI is doing all the thinking, learning isn't happening. Identify where student thinking happens and protect those moments.

**What foundational skills are required?** Don't allow AI shortcuts for skills students haven't yet developed. Sequence matters.

**How will you know if dependency is developing?** Build in AI-free assessments to check that students can perform independently. A student who excels with AI but struggles without it may have a dependency problem.

**How will students reflect on their AI use?** Require documentation of AI interactions and reflection on how AI helped or didn't help. Make AI use visible and thoughtful.

<Callout type="tip" title="The 'without AI' test">
Periodically give students tasks they normally complete with AI assistance—but without AI. This isn't punishment; it's diagnosis. If performance collapses, you've identified a dependency to address.
</Callout>

## The Honest Answer

Is AI making students dumber? No—not necessarily. It's creating conditions that can either build or undermine cognitive capabilities depending on how it's used.

The schools that navigate this well will be intentional about when AI is and isn't appropriate, protect foundational skill development before allowing AI enhancement, and design learning that keeps students thinking, not just prompting.

The schools that get this wrong will let AI handle more and more cognitive work until students can't function without it.

The difference is design. Be intentional.
