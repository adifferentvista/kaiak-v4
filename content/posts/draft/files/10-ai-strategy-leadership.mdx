Last year, I sat in a leadership meeting where someone suggested we "let IT handle the AI thing." It seemed reasonable. AI is technology. IT handles technology. Problem solved.

Except it's not that simple. And I've come to believe that delegating AI strategy to IT—even a capable IT department—is one of the biggest mistakes a school leader can make.

## Why AI Is Different

AI isn't like the technology that came before it. It's not a faster computer, a better projector, or a more efficient student information system.

Previous educational technology automated tasks. AI performs cognitive work—the kind of work we traditionally considered uniquely human. It can write, analyze, evaluate, create, and reason. Those capabilities change what it means to teach and learn in ways that projectors never did.

When a student asks AI to write their essay, that's not a technology question. It's a question about learning, integrity, skill development, and the purpose of education itself. When a teacher uses AI to provide feedback, that's not a technology question. It's a question about the role of human relationships in education, the nature of evaluation, and what we value in teaching.

These questions don't belong to IT. They belong to educational leaders.

<Callout type="warning" title="The delegation trap">
Delegating AI to IT implicitly treats it as an operational issue rather than a strategic one. It signals that AI is about tools, not teaching. It ensures that the people making decisions don't have the educational context to make them well.

## Decisions Only Leaders Can Make

Some AI decisions are technical: which tools to adopt, how to ensure data security, what infrastructure is needed. IT can and should handle these.

But the most important decisions aren't technical. They're philosophical and pedagogical. And they require educational leadership.

**What's your educational philosophy about AI?** Is AI a tool to enhance human capability, or a shortcut that undermines skill development? Is AI assistance something to embrace, tolerate, or resist? There's no right answer, but there needs to be an answer—and it shapes everything else.

**Where's the line between efficiency and learning?** AI can make education more efficient. But efficiency isn't always the goal. Some productive struggle is essential for learning. Deciding which inefficiencies to preserve and which to eliminate is an educational judgment, not a technical one.

**What expectations will you communicate to families?** Parents want to know how you're thinking about AI. They want to understand the school's approach. A Head of School can answer these questions. IT cannot.

**How will you respond to integrity violations?** When a student uses AI inappropriately, what happens? The answer involves educational philosophy, developmental considerations, relationship preservation, and institutional values. It's not a technical decision.

**Where will you invest limited resources?** AI training for teachers, new tools for students, time for policy development—all compete for limited attention and budget. Prioritization is a leadership function.

## What Visible Leadership Looks Like

Visible AI leadership isn't about being an AI expert. It's about being present, engaged, and clearly the person making decisions.

**Use AI yourself.** You can't lead an AI strategy you don't understand. Experiment with tools. Feel what they can and can't do. Experience the temptations and frustrations your teachers and students face. Your personal experience gives you credibility and insight.

**Be present for AI discussions.** When teachers discuss AI challenges, be there—not to dictate, but to understand. When parents raise concerns, engage directly. When policies are developed, be involved. Presence signals priority.

**Share your learning publicly.** Model the learning stance you want from others. "I've been experimenting with AI and here's what I'm discovering" is more powerful than pronouncements from on high. Show that you're figuring it out too.

**Make decisions visibly.** When you make choices about AI—approving tools, setting expectations, responding to incidents—be clear that you're making them. Own the decisions. Explain your reasoning. Let people see leadership in action.

**Invite challenge.** The AI landscape is uncertain. Good leaders invite pushback on their positions. "I think X, but I'm not sure—tell me why I'm wrong" creates productive dialogue. Certainty is false comfort.

## Building Your Own Fluency

You don't need to be an AI expert, but you need enough fluency to lead. Here's a practical path:

**Use AI tools weekly.** Not to become an expert, but to develop intuition. Use them for your own work—drafting communications, summarizing documents, exploring ideas. Feel what they can and can't do.

**Read selectively, not exhaustively.** AI news is overwhelming. Find two or three trusted sources and follow them. You need to stay current, not comprehensive.

**Talk to your teachers.** The people using AI daily in your context know things you don't. Ask what's working, what's not, what they're struggling with. Their experience is your best data.

**Connect with peers.** Other school leaders face the same challenges. Conversations with peers—about what they're trying, what's working, what's failing—are invaluable.

**Accept uncertainty.** Nobody has figured this out yet. The leaders who will navigate AI best are those comfortable with uncertainty, willing to experiment, and prepared to adjust as they learn.

<Callout type="tip" title="The fluency threshold">
You need enough AI fluency to ask good questions, not enough to have all the answers. Can you evaluate whether a proposed AI tool makes educational sense? Can you understand why a teacher is excited or concerned about AI? That's the threshold.

## The Cost of Absence

When school leaders delegate AI to IT and step back, several things happen.

Policies reflect technical thinking, not educational thinking. They focus on what's possible rather than what's pedagogically sound.

Teachers feel unsupported. They're navigating complex questions without visible leadership guidance.

Parents get mixed messages. Different parts of the school communicate differently because there's no unified voice.

Decisions get made by default rather than by design. The absence of strategy is still a strategy—just a bad one.

AI is reshaping education. That process will be navigated well or poorly. The difference depends largely on whether educational leaders lead—or delegate to others what only they can do.
