Last month, a Head of School asked me a question that stopped me cold.

"I keep hearing I need AI skills," she said. "But I'm not a tech person. I'm an educator. Why should I spend my limited time learning tools that my IT team can handle?"

I understood the question. I'd asked it myself two years ago.

Here's what I've learned since: AI isn't a technology skill. It's a leadership skill. And the gap between leaders who understand this and those who don't is widening fast.

## The Numbers Are Stark

Let me start with some data that changed how I think about this.

[PwC's research](https://www.pwc.com/) found that workers with advanced AI skills earn **56% more** than peers in the same roles without those skills. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries most exposed to AI since 2022.

But here's the number that matters most for school leaders: [RAND's 2025 study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA4180-1.html) found that **54% of students and 53% of teachers** are already using AI for school. Yet only **35% of districts** provide any AI training to students, and over **80% of students** report that teachers never explicitly taught them how to use AI.

Read that again. More than half of your students and teachers are using AI. Most are figuring it out alone.

Who do you think should be leading that conversation?

## Why "My IT Team Can Handle It" Doesn't Work

I used to delegate technology decisions entirely to my IT coordinator. "You're the expert," I'd say. "Just tell me what we need."

This worked for network infrastructure and device management. It doesn't work for AI.

Here's why: AI isn't primarily a technical decision. It's a strategic, pedagogical, and cultural decision.

When a teacher uses ChatGPT to draft report card comments, that's not an IT issue. It's a question of academic integrity, voice, workload, and professional judgment. When students use AI to complete assignments, that's not about software—it's about learning, assessment validity, and school culture.

[Harvard Business Review's research](https://hbr.org/2025/10/5-critical-skills-leaders-need-in-the-age-of-ai) analyzed over 34 million managerial job postings and identified five critical skills leaders need in the AI age. None of them are technical. They're all about judgment, orchestration, and organizational design.

Your IT team can set up the tools. They can't decide how your school should think about AI. That's your job.

## What "AI Literacy" Actually Means for School Leaders

When I talk about AI skills for leaders, I don't mean prompt engineering or understanding neural networks.

I mean three things:

### 1. Understanding What AI Can (and Can't) Do

You need enough hands-on experience to have informed opinions. Not expert opinions—informed ones.

When a teacher tells you AI "doesn't work" for their subject, you should know whether that's true or whether they just haven't found the right application. When a parent complains that AI is "cheating," you should be able to explain the difference between using AI as a shortcut and using it as a tool.

This doesn't require deep technical knowledge. It requires personal experimentation. You have to use these tools yourself.

### 2. Making Strategic Decisions About AI in Your School

Should AI be allowed on assessments? Which ones? With what guidelines?

How should teachers be using AI for planning, communication, and administration?

What training do staff need? What policies do you need to create?

These decisions can't be delegated. They require understanding your school's context, values, and culture—and understanding enough about AI to make choices that align with them.

### 3. Leading the Cultural Shift

[IMD's 2026 analysis](https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/artificial-intelligence/2026-ai-trends-what-leaders-need-to-know-to-stay-competitive/) put it bluntly: "The most successful organizations will stop treating AI as a technology race and start treating it as a management revolution."

AI adoption in schools isn't about buying tools. It's about changing how people work, learn, and think. That requires leadership—visible, informed leadership—not IT support.

When I started using AI openly for my own work—sharing how I drafted board reports, processed emails, and prepared meeting agendas—it gave my staff permission to explore. My visible adoption normalized theirs.

Leaders model behavior. If you're not using AI, you're modeling avoidance.

## The Cost of Waiting

Here's what happens when school leaders don't develop AI literacy:

**You lose control of the narrative.** Students and teachers will use AI whether you have a policy or not. Without informed leadership, that use will be haphazard, inconsistent, and probably problematic. You'll be reacting instead of guiding.

**You miss efficiency gains.** [Research suggests](https://www.shrm.org/about/press-room/what-will-work-look-like-in-2026--new-shrm-research-reveals-how-) that workers save an average of two hours per day using AI tools effectively. For school leaders drowning in administrative work, that's not trivial. It's transformative.

**You can't evaluate what you don't understand.** When vendors pitch AI products, when teachers propose AI-enhanced lessons, when board members ask about your AI strategy—you need enough knowledge to ask good questions. Otherwise, you're making decisions blind.

**You become the bottleneck.** [IDC estimates](https://www.workera.ai/blog/the-5-5-trillion-skills-gap-what-idcs-new-report-reveals-about-ai-workforce-readiness) that skills shortages may cost the global economy up to $5.5 trillion by 2026. In schools, the bottleneck is often leadership hesitation. When you don't understand AI, you slow down the people who do.

## What I Did (And What I'd Recommend)

When I realized AI literacy wasn't optional, I took three steps:

### Step 1: Personal Experimentation (First Month)

I committed to using AI for one task each day. Not teaching others—just using it myself.

- Drafting emails to parents
- Summarizing meeting notes
- Creating agendas from scattered discussion points
- Generating first drafts of policy documents

Most of these saved time. Some didn't work well. Both outcomes were valuable. I learned what AI was actually good at—and what still required my full attention.

### Step 2: Informed Policy Development (Months 2-3)

With hands-on experience, I could finally have real conversations about AI policy. Not theoretical debates about what AI might do—practical discussions about what it actually does.

We developed guidelines for:
- Teacher use (administrative vs. instructional)
- Student use (by grade level and assessment type)
- Communication transparency (when AI-assisted work needed disclosure)

These policies weren't perfect. But they were grounded in experience rather than fear.

### Step 3: Leading the Training (Ongoing)

I didn't hand AI training to IT. I was present for it. Sometimes I led sessions. Sometimes I just participated visibly.

This sent a message: AI is a leadership priority, not a tech initiative. [When I trained 50+ teachers on AI](/blog/trained-50-teachers-on-ai), the most important thing wasn't my expertise. It was my visible commitment.

## The Specific Skills That Matter Most

Based on my experience and [Harvard Business Review's framework](https://hbr.org/2025/10/5-critical-skills-leaders-need-in-the-age-of-ai), here's what I'd prioritize:

**Build diverse networks.** Talk to leaders in other industries about how they're using AI. Talk to teachers who are experimenting. Talk to skeptics. Exposure builds fluency faster than courses.

**Learn to orchestrate, not execute.** Your job isn't to be the AI expert. It's to bring together the people, tools, and processes that make AI work for your school. Think conductor, not soloist.

**Coach and develop others.** Create psychological safety for experimentation. Celebrate failures as learning. The [Adecco Group's research](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/2026-workforce-outlook-employers-prioritize-ai-literacy-and-education-benefits-can) shows that when employers provide AI training, adoption jumps from 25% to 76%. Your role is to enable that.

**Model adoption.** Use AI visibly. Share what works and what doesn't. Your behavior gives permission.

## This Isn't About Becoming Technical

I want to be clear: I'm not asking you to become a technology expert.

I'm asking you to be an informed leader in a world where AI is reshaping every domain—including education.

[McKinsey's research](https://www.mckinsey.com/) confirms that 91% of companies use at least one AI tool. The [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/) reports that 75% of companies worldwide plan to adopt AI by 2027. This isn't coming. It's here.

The question isn't whether to engage with AI. It's whether you'll lead that engagement or be led by it.

## Where to Start

If you're not sure how to begin, here's what I'd suggest:

**This week:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft one email you'd normally write yourself. Edit it to match your voice. Notice what it got right and what it missed.

**This month:** Have a conversation with three teachers about how they're using AI. Don't evaluate—just listen. You'll learn more from their experiments than from any article.

**This quarter:** Draft a working AI policy for one area of school operations. Not a permanent policy—a starting point. The process of writing it will clarify your thinking.

The goal isn't mastery. The goal is informed leadership.
