# KAIAK Content System

Your writing partner for creating content that sounds like a knowledgeable peer, not a corporate blog or AI output.

## Core Philosophy

Three rules govern everything:

1. **Start with something worth saying** — If you can't articulate what only YOU can say about this topic, you're not ready to write
2. **Say it in your voice** — Match the reader's internal monologue, not a press release
3. **Use AI to say it better** — Not to generate ideas, but to sharpen yours

## The Anti-Slop Filter

Before writing anything, internalize what to AVOID. These patterns instantly signal "AI wrote this":

### Banned Phrases (Hard Rules)

Never use:
- "In today's fast-paced world/digital landscape..."
- "It's not about X—it's about Y" (the false dichotomy closer)
- "Game-changing," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "innovative"
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Let's dive in," "Let's unpack this," "Let's explore"
- "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally" as transitions
- "It's important to note that..."
- "This is where X comes in"
- "Whether you're a [X] or a [Y]..."
- "The short answer is... The long answer is..."
- "And honestly?" (especially when followed by something not actually that honest)
- "Here's the kicker" / "And the best part?" / "Here's the part most people miss"
- "Here's the breakdown:"
- "No fluff" / "Shouting into the void"
- "Curious what others think" (performative engagement bait)
- "I'm going to state this as clearly as possible" (then 600 words that could be 2 sentences)

### The "Quiet" Epidemic

AI loves the word "quiet" as a modifier. Avoid:
- "Quiet confidence"
- "Quiet truth"
- "Quietly growing"
- "Quiet rebellion"

If the thing is true, just say it. You don't need to make it "quiet."

### Therapist Mode (Unsolicited Validation)

These phrases signal AI trying to be emotionally supportive without earning it:
- "You're not imagining it"
- "You're not alone"
- "You're not broken"
- "You're not weak"
- "Do you want to sit with that for a while?"
- "Are you ready to go deeper?"
- "You're right to push back on that" (forced validation after any pushback)

### Structural Tells to Avoid

- **The Triple Header** — "What is X? Why does X matter? How to do X?" (every AI article ever)
- **The Hollow Transition** — "Now that we've covered X, let's move on to Y"
- **The Non-Specific List** — Bullets that could apply to any topic
- **The Hedged Conclusion** — "Ultimately, the best approach depends on your situation"
- **Committee Voice** — Writing that sounds like it was approved by legal
- **Contrast Framing on Repeat** — "It's not X, it's Y" used over and over as a crutch
- **Over-Explicit Signposting** — "Here is the key takeaway" / "The important part is this" / "Let me be clear about one thing"
- **Fragmented Pseudo-Profundity** — Short. Sentences. That feel. Reflective. But say nothing.
- **Misfit Metaphors** — Comparisons that sound smart but feel slightly off, like the writer doesn't fully understand what they're describing

### What to Do Instead

| AI Pattern | Human Alternative |
|------------|-------------------|
| "There are several reasons why..." | Jump straight to reason #1 |
| "It's worth noting that..." | Just state the thing |
| "This can help you..." | "This does X" (be direct) |
| "Many experts believe..." | Name the expert or cut it |
| "In conclusion..." | No announcement needed—just conclude |

### Your Own Pattern Staleness

Even good moves become tics if overused. Watch for these in your own writing:

**Structural moves to rotate (don't use the same one in consecutive posts):**
- "This isn't X. It's Y." — the reframe
- "The [adjective] truth:" — the reveal ("honest truth," "boring truth," "brutal truth")
- Numbered shifts/principles (Shift 1, Shift 2...)
- Colon-after-bold headers (**The vision:** / **The reality:**)
- "Three questions that..." — the framework tease
- "The key insight:" — the pivot

**Self-check before publishing:** Scan your last 3 posts. If the same structural move appears in all of them, vary this one.

**The intro test:** Read your last 3 opening paragraphs back-to-back. Do they sound like the same template with different words? If yes, rewrite.

## The Tactical Setup

Before outlining, answer these questions (don't skip):

1. **What's the specific pain point?** (Not "productivity" — that's too vague. "Spending 3 hours on weekly reports that nobody reads" is specific.)

2. **What are the 2-4 tactical takeaways?** (The Meat — what will they DO differently after reading?)

3. **What's your unique angle?** (Why should they read YOUR take vs. the 50 other posts on this topic?)

4. **What evidence do you have?** (Data, benchmarks, case studies, personal experience)

## Outline Framework

Use this structure for tactical guides and blog posts:

```markdown
# [Working Title]

## The Hook (2-3 sentences max)
- The Problem: [Specific, felt pain]
- The Promise: "Here's exactly how to [specific outcome]"

## The Meat

### Tactic 1: [Action-oriented title]
- **The move**: [What to actually do]
- **Why it works**: [Brief rationale]
- **Example**: [Concrete illustration]
- [VISUAL: Diagram/screenshot/template placeholder]

### Tactic 2: [Action-oriented title]
- **The move**: [What to actually do]
- **Watch out for**: [Common pitfall]
- **Example**: [Concrete illustration]
- [VISUAL: Before/after, workflow, or meme]

### Tactic 3: [Action-oriented title]
- **The move**: [What to actually do]
- **The proof**: [Data point or case study]
- [VISUAL: Chart, comparison, or screenshot]

## The Bottom Line
- Summary as single paragraph (not bullets)
- The "so what" — why this matters NOW
- One clear next step

## Research Gaps
- [ ] Need data on [specific claim]
- [ ] Find example of [concept in action]
- [ ] Source for [assertion]
```

## Bold-First Rule

Every bullet point starts with the insight in **bold**. The reader scanning should get value from bold text alone.

**Bad:**
- You should always test your headlines before publishing to see which ones perform better with your audience.

**Good:**
- **Test headlines before publishing.** A/B test 2-3 options; pick the winner after 100 impressions.

## MDX Components

These components add visual rhythm and break up text walls. Use them intentionally, not as decoration.

### Callouts (Colored Highlight Boxes)

```mdx
<Callout type="tip" title="The Key Move">
Your insight here. Keep it to 2-3 sentences max.
</Callout>
```

**Types and when to use them:**

| Type | Color | Use For |
|------|-------|---------|
| `tip` | Green/teal | Actionable insight, the "aha" moment |
| `story` | Blue/neutral | Personal anecdote, confession, specific example |
| `warning` | Yellow/orange | Counterintuitive point, common mistake, "watch out" |

**Callout titles that work:**
- "The Key Move" — for tactical posts
- "A confession" — for vulnerability/credibility
- "The thing nobody tells you" — for insider knowledge
- Untitled — when the content speaks for itself

**Avoid:** Generic titles like "Important!" or "Note:" — they add nothing.

### Before/After Comparisons

```mdx
<BeforeAfter 
  before="2+ hours drafting individual responses"
  after="15-20 minutes reviewing AI drafts"
  context="Optional explanatory line"
/>
```

**Use when:** Showing transformation, time savings, mindset shifts. The contrast should be concrete and specific, not vague ("better" → "much better").

### Related Posts

```mdx
<RelatedPost 
  slug="post-slug" 
  title="The Full Post Title"
  context="Why this connects → "
/>
```

**Use when:** There's a genuine "read next" connection, not just internal linking for SEO.

### Time Saved (Credibility Builder)

```mdx
<TimeSaved hours={3} task="parent email responses" frequency="per week" />
```

**Use when:** You have real data. Don't guess. Specificity builds trust; vague claims erode it.

### Call to Action

```mdx
<CallToAction text="Want help with X?" link="/booking" />
```

**Use:** Once per post, at the end. Never mid-article.

---

## Visual Cadence

Insert a visual element every 300-500 words:
- Screenshot of a tool or interface
- Simple diagram or flowchart
- Comparison table
- Meme (if appropriate to voice)
- Before/after example
- Code snippet or template

Mark these in your outline: `[VISUAL: description]`

## Voice Preservation

### Calibration Questions

Ask periodically while drafting:
- "Does this sound like something I'd actually say?"
- "Would I be embarrassed to read this aloud?"
- "Is this how I'd explain it to a peer over coffee?"

### Tone Markers for KAIAK Content

- **Direct but warm** — Not cold/corporate, not overly casual
- **Peer-to-peer** — You're the knowledgeable colleague, not the guru
- **Specific over general** — Numbers, names, concrete examples
- **Permission to be opinionated** — Take a stance, don't hedge everything

### Phrases That Sound Human

- "Here's the thing..."
- "I've seen this go wrong when..."
- "The real problem is..."
- "What actually works is..."
- "Let me be specific..."
- "This sounds obvious, but..."

## Section-by-Section Feedback

When reviewing a section, evaluate:

```markdown
## Feedback: [Section Name]

### What Works
- [Specific strength]
- [Specific strength]

### Sharpen These
- **Vague claim** → Make specific: [suggestion]
- **Missing evidence** → Add: [what's needed]
- **AI-sounding phrase** → Replace with: [alternative]
- **Buried lead** → Move this up: [the real point]

### Voice Check
- Sounds like you: Yes/No
- Tone match: [assessment]
```

## Research & Citation

### The Hallucination Problem

AI frequently invents links, misattributes quotes, and cites sources that don't exist. Every reference needs manual verification.

**Before adding any link or citation:**
1. Click the link — does it actually load?
2. Find the claim — does the source actually say what you're attributing to it?
3. Check the date — is this still current/relevant?
4. Verify the author — is this person real and did they actually say this?

If you can't verify it, don't use it. A missing citation is better than a fake one.

### Finding Evidence

Prioritize in this order:
1. **Your own experience** — Most valuable, can't be replicated
2. **Named case studies** — "Airbnb does X" beats "companies do X"
3. **Specific data** — "43% improvement" beats "significant improvement"
4. **Expert quotes** — Named person > "experts say"

### Citation Format (Light Touch)

For blog/newsletter content, use inline attribution:
- "According to McKinsey's 2024 report, 40% of..."
- "As Teresa Torres puts it, '...'"

Save formal citations for longer guides or when credibility is critical.

### Research Output Template

```markdown
## Research: [Topic]

### Key Data Points
- **[Stat]**: [Source, Year] — ✓ Verified / ⏳ Needs check
- **[Stat]**: [Source, Year] — ✓ Verified / ⏳ Needs check

### Usable Examples
- **[Company/Person]**: [What they did] — [Result]

### Expert Perspective
- "[Quote]" — [Name, Role] — ✓ Quote verified at [link]

### Gaps Still Needed
- [ ] [Specific missing piece]

### Links to Verify Before Publish
- [ ] [URL 1]
- [ ] [URL 2]
```

## Hook Improvement

When a hook is weak, offer 3 alternatives:

**Original**: [paste their hook]

**Option 1 — The Specific Problem**:
> [Hook that names exact pain point]

**Option 2 — The Surprising Data**:
> [Hook with counterintuitive stat or fact]

**Option 3 — The Micro-Story**:
> [Hook with brief narrative setup]

**Why these work**: [Brief explanation of what makes hooks effective]

## Final Polish Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

### Content Quality

### Pattern Staleness Check
- [ ] Scanned last 3 posts for repeated structural moves
- [ ] This intro doesn't mirror the last one
- [ ] Varied my callout titles (not reusing "The key insight" again)
- [ ] Different section rhythm than recent posts

### Structure Check
- [ ] Bold-first on all bullets
- [ ] Visual every 300-500 words
- [ ] Hook delivers promise within first 100 words
- [ ] Clear single CTA at end

### SEO Check
- [ ] Primary keyword in title and first 100 words

- [ ] Comparison table included (if relevant)
- [ ] FAQ section added (for cornerstone content)
- [ ] Author byline and credentials visible
- [ ] "Updated" or publish date visible

## SEO & GEO Optimization

Content must be optimized for two discovery channels: traditional search engines (SEO) and AI-powered answer engines (GEO). These complement each other—strong SEO is the foundation that AI systems draw from.

### Understanding the Dual-Search World

| SEO | GEO |
|-----|-----|
| Rank on Google page 1 | Get cited in AI-generated answers |
| Keywords + backlinks | Clear claims + authoritative sourcing |
| Click-through optimization | "Citability" — quotable statements |
| Meta descriptions for humans | Content AI can confidently attribute |
| 10 blue links to compete for | Only 2-7 domains cited per AI response |

**Why both matter:** 87% of ChatGPT's cited sources overlap with Bing's top organic results. Without strong SEO fundamentals, GEO is an uphill battle. But SEO alone won't guarantee AI citations.

---

### SEO Fundamentals (Still Essential)

**Structure & Technical:**
- **Clear heading hierarchy** — H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- **Meta description** — 150-160 characters, include primary keyword, compelling hook
- **Internal linking** — Connect to relevant pillar content and related posts
- **URL structure** — Short, descriptive slugs with primary keyword
- **Mobile optimization** — Fast load times, responsive design
- **Schema markup** — FAQPage, HowTo, Article schemas help both search and AI

**Content Quality (E-E-A-T):**
- **Experience** — Share first-hand knowledge, real examples from your work
- **Expertise** — Demonstrate deep understanding, not surface-level summaries
- **Authoritativeness** — Build topic authority through consistent, comprehensive coverage
- **Trustworthiness** — Cite sources, maintain accuracy, transparent author attribution

**Keyword Integration (Natural, Not Stuffed):**
- Primary keyword in title, first 100 words, and 1-2 H2s
- Semantic variations throughout (AI understands synonyms)
- Question-based keywords match conversational search
- Avoid keyword density thinking—write for humans first

### GEO: Generative Engine Optimization

GEO optimizes content to be cited by AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overviews). The goal: become the source AI trusts enough to quote.

#### The Core Principles

**1. Answer-First Structure**
Put the direct answer in the first 40-60 words. AI extracts from the top of content.

```markdown
❌ "Many people wonder about the best way to handle AI in schools. 
   There are several perspectives to consider, and the answer depends 
   on various factors..."

✓ "Schools implementing assessment redesign see 40% fewer AI-related 
   integrity issues compared to detection-only approaches. The shift 
   from catching cheaters to designing better assignments is working."
```

**2. Fact Density**
Include specific statistics, data points, or concrete examples every 150-200 words. AI loves citing numbers.

- **Bad:** "Many teachers lack AI training"
- **Good:** "68% of urban teachers report receiving zero AI training since joining their schools"

**3. Quotable Statements**
Write clear, declarative sentences that AI can lift directly. Front-load the insight.

- **Bad:** "It's worth considering that the approach to detection might not be the most effective strategy when it comes to maintaining academic integrity in an era of AI."
- **Good:** "Detection tools are unreliable—94% of AI-generated work goes undetected."

**4. Structured for Extraction**
Pages with clear H2/H3/bullet structures are 40% more likely to be cited. AI parses structure to find relevant chunks.

- Use descriptive headings (question-based work well)
- Break walls of text into scannable sections
- Use tables for comparisons
- Use numbered lists for processes
- Keep paragraphs focused on one idea each

**5. Source Transparency**
Cite your sources explicitly. AI rewards transparent attribution.

```markdown
❌ "Research shows that..." / "Studies indicate..."
✓ "According to Packback's 2025 analysis, faculty rate AI-specific 
   plagiarism policies as only 28% effective."
```

#### GEO Content Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] **First 50 words contain the core answer** — Don't bury the lead
- [ ] **At least 3 specific statistics with sources** — Data every 150-200 words
- [ ] **Question-based H2 headings** — Match how people prompt AI ("How do I...", "What is...", "Why does...")
- [ ] **Clear, quotable thesis statements** — 1-2 sentences AI can lift verbatim
- [ ] **Comparison tables where relevant** — AI loves structured data
- [ ] **Named examples over generic** — "Airbnb does X" beats "companies do X"
- [ ] **Author credentials visible** — Byline, bio, expertise signals
- [ ] **Recent data and updates** — AI favors fresh content; update dates matter
- [ ] **FAQ section with schema** — Q&A format is the highest-performing for GEO

#### Platform-Specific Notes

Different AI platforms have different preferences:

| Platform | Preferences |
|----------|-------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Encyclopedic content, Wikipedia-style comprehensiveness. ~48% of citations come from Wikipedia/Reddit. Authority matters heavily. |
| **Perplexity** | Rewards recency and community examples. Fresher content ranks better. |
| **Google AI Overviews** | Prioritizes existing top-ranking content. Strong SEO = better AI Overview presence. |
| **Claude** | Values nuanced, well-reasoned content with clear structure. |

**Universal truth:** Well-structured, authoritative, current content performs across all platforms.

#### GEO-Optimized Section Template

```markdown
## [Question-Based Heading: What/How/Why]

[Direct answer in 1-2 sentences with specific claim or stat]

[Supporting context: why this matters, brief explanation]

[Specific example or data point with source]

<Callout type="tip" title="[Quotable Insight]">
[2-3 sentence takeaway that AI could cite directly]
</Callout>

[Additional depth, but organized with clear subheadings if long]
```

#### The FAQ Pattern (Highest GEO Performance)

Add an FAQ section to cornerstone content. Format:

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### [Exact question someone would ask AI]

[Direct 2-3 sentence answer with specific data if available]

### [Another natural question]

[Direct answer, no hedging]
```

Implement FAQPage schema for these sections—it signals to both search and AI that this content directly answers questions.
