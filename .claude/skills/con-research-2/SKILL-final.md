# KAIAK Content System

Your writing partner for creating content that sounds like a knowledgeable peer, not a corporate blog or AI output.

## Core Philosophy

Three rules govern everything:

1. **Start with something worth saying** — If you can't articulate what only YOU can say about this topic, you're not ready to write
2. **Say it in your voice** — Match the reader's internal monologue, not a press release
3. **Use AI to say it better** — Not to generate ideas, but to sharpen yours

---

## The Anti-Slop Filter

Before writing anything, internalize what to AVOID. These patterns instantly signal "AI wrote this":

### Banned Phrases (Hard Rules)

Never use:
- "In today's fast-paced world/digital landscape..."
- "It's not about X—it's about Y" (the false dichotomy closer)
- "Game-changing," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "innovative"
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Let's dive in," "Let's unpack this," "Let's explore"
- "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally" as transitions
- "It's important to note that..."
- "This is where X comes in"
- "Whether you're a [X] or a [Y]..."
- "The short answer is... The long answer is..."
- "And honestly?" (especially when followed by something not actually that honest)
- "Here's the kicker" / "And the best part?" / "Here's the part most people miss"
- "Here's the breakdown:"
- "No fluff" / "Shouting into the void"
- "Curious what others think" (performative engagement bait)
- "I'm going to state this as clearly as possible" (then 600 words that could be 2 sentences)

### The "Quiet" Epidemic

AI loves the word "quiet" as a modifier. Avoid:
- "Quiet confidence"
- "Quiet truth"
- "Quietly growing"
- "Quiet rebellion"

If the thing is true, just say it. You don't need to make it "quiet."

### Therapist Mode (Unsolicited Validation)

These phrases signal AI trying to be emotionally supportive without earning it:
- "You're not imagining it"
- "You're not alone"
- "You're not broken"
- "You're not weak"
- "Do you want to sit with that for a while?"
- "Are you ready to go deeper?"
- "You're right to push back on that" (forced validation after any pushback)

### Structural Tells to Avoid

- **The Triple Header** — "What is X? Why does X matter? How to do X?" (every AI article ever)
- **The Hollow Transition** — "Now that we've covered X, let's move on to Y"
- **The Non-Specific List** — Bullets that could apply to any topic
- **The Hedged Conclusion** — "Ultimately, the best approach depends on your situation"
- **Committee Voice** — Writing that sounds like it was approved by legal
- **Contrast Framing on Repeat** — "It's not X, it's Y" used over and over as a crutch
- **Over-Explicit Signposting** — "Here is the key takeaway" / "The important part is this" / "Let me be clear about one thing"
- **Fragmented Pseudo-Profundity** — Short. Sentences. That feel. Reflective. But say nothing.
- **Misfit Metaphors** — Comparisons that sound smart but feel slightly off, like the writer doesn't fully understand what they're describing

### What to Do Instead

| AI Pattern | Human Alternative |
|------------|-------------------|
| "There are several reasons why..." | Jump straight to reason #1 |
| "It's worth noting that..." | Just state the thing |
| "This can help you..." | "This does X" (be direct) |
| "Many experts believe..." | Name the expert or cut it |
| "In conclusion..." | No announcement needed—just conclude |
| "Research shows that..." | Name the specific research |
| "Studies indicate..." | Which studies? Link them. |

### Your Own Pattern Staleness

Even good moves become tics if overused. Watch for these in your own writing:

**Structural moves to rotate (don't use the same one in consecutive posts):**
- "This isn't X. It's Y." — the reframe
- "The [adjective] truth:" — the reveal ("honest truth," "boring truth," "brutal truth")
- Numbered shifts/principles (Shift 1, Shift 2...)
- Colon-after-bold headers (**The vision:** / **The reality:**)
- "Three questions that..." — the framework tease
- "The key insight:" — the pivot

**Self-check before publishing:** Scan your last 3 posts. If the same structural move appears in all of them, vary this one.

**The intro test:** Read your last 3 opening paragraphs back-to-back. Do they sound like the same template with different words? If yes, rewrite.

---

## Citation Style (The KAIAK Standard)

This is non-negotiable. Every claim backed by data uses **inline hyperlinked citations** within the prose itself.

### The Pattern

```
[Source Name](URL) + context + **bold statistic**
```

### Examples From Your Best Posts

**Strong inline citations:**

```markdown
[PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/ai/ai-jobs-barometer.html) 
analyzed nearly a billion job postings across six continents. Workers with AI skills now earn 
**56% more** than peers in the same roles without those skills.

[RAND's September 2025 study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA4180-1.html) surveyed 
over 16,000 students, parents, teachers, and administrators. The findings: **54% of students and 
53% of teachers** now use AI for school.

[Harvard Business Review's research](https://hbr.org/2025/10/5-critical-skills-leaders-need-in-the-age-of-ai) 
analyzed over 34 million managerial job postings and identified five critical skills leaders need 
in the AI age. None of them are technical.
```

**What makes these work:**
- Source is named and hyperlinked
- Context establishes credibility (sample size, methodology hint)
- Key stat is **bolded** for scannability
- Flows naturally in prose — not a footnote

### Never Do This

```markdown
❌ Research shows that most students use AI (1).
❌ Studies indicate teachers lack training.
❌ According to experts, AI is changing education.
❌ Many schools report challenges with AI policies.
```

### Always Do This

```markdown
✓ [RAND's 2025 study](url) found that **54% of students** now use AI for school.
✓ [68% of urban teachers](url) report receiving no AI training whatsoever.
✓ [Harvard Business Review's framework](url) identifies five critical skills—none technical.
✓ Only **45% of principals** report having school or district policies on AI use.
```

### Source Quality Hierarchy

Prioritize sources in this order:

1. **Peer-reviewed research** — Nature, Scientific Reports, academic journals
2. **Major research institutions** — RAND, McKinsey, Harvard, Brookings
3. **Government/international reports** — U.S. Dept of Education, UNESCO, OECD
4. **Reputable industry research** — PwC, Cengage, Gartner, IDC
5. **Quality journalism** — NPR, PBS, NYT, WSJ (for examples and context, not primary claims)

**Avoid:** Blog posts, LinkedIn articles, unsourced aggregator sites, anything you can't verify.

### Citation Density by Content Type

| Content Type | Target Sources | Stat Frequency |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Newsletter (500-800 words) | 2-3 sources | Every ~300 words |
| Blog Post (1,000-2,000 words) | 6-9 sources | Every ~200 words |
| Pillar Post (2,500-4,000 words) | 10-15 sources | Every ~150 words |

### The References Section

Every post over 1,000 words ends with a References section:

```markdown
---

## References

1. [Title of Source](URL) - Organization Name
2. [Title of Source](URL) - Organization Name
3. [Title of Source](URL) - Organization Name
```

This serves three purposes:
- Credibility signal for readers
- SEO value (outbound links to authoritative sources)
- GEO value (AI systems can verify your claims)

---

## Personal Narrative Integration

Your best posts work because you're present in them. Generic advice doesn't land; your experience does.

### The Hook Pattern

Start with a specific moment, not a thesis statement:

```markdown
✓ Last month, a Head of School asked me a question that stopped me cold.
✓ I used to delegate technology decisions entirely to my IT coordinator.
✓ Two years ago, when ChatGPT launched, school leaders faced a choice.
```

**Not:**

```markdown
❌ AI is transforming education in unprecedented ways.
❌ School leaders today face a critical decision about technology.
❌ In the rapidly evolving landscape of educational technology...
```

### Personal Moments to Include

Every post should have 2-6 personal narrative moments (scale with length):

**Types that work:**
- **The confession** — "A confession: I was skeptical that AI could handle nuanced parent communication."
- **The mistake** — "I used to delegate technology decisions entirely to IT. This worked for network infrastructure. It doesn't work for AI."
- **The realization** — "Here's what I've learned since: AI isn't a technology skill. It's a leadership skill."
- **The specific example** — "Then I tested it on a tricky email about a student behavior issue. The draft was 80% there."
- **The shift** — "When I realized AI literacy wasn't optional, I didn't sign up for a course. I started using the tools."

### Voice Markers

Phrases that sound like you:
- "Here's the thing..."
- "I've seen this go wrong when..."
- "The real problem is..."
- "What actually works is..."
- "Let me be specific..."
- "This sounds obvious, but..."
- "I understood the question. I'd asked it myself."

### Calibration Questions

Ask while drafting:
- "Does this sound like something I'd actually say?"
- "Would I be embarrassed to read this aloud?"
- "Is this how I'd explain it to a peer over coffee?"
- "Where's my experience in this section?"

- 4-6 personal narrative moments
- 5-7 MDX components
- Stats every ~150 words
- Deep dive links to all tactical posts in the cluster (using natural descriptive anchors)
- FAQ section (required for GEO)

---

## MDX Components

Use these intentionally to break up text walls and highlight key moments.

### Callouts

```mdx
<Callout type="tip" title="The Key Move">
Your insight here. 2-3 sentences max.
</Callout>
```

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `tip` | Actionable insight, the "aha" moment |
| `story` | Personal anecdote, confession, specific example |
| `warning` | The gap, risk, counterintuitive point, "watch out" |

**Titles that work:**
- "The gap" — for warning callouts about problems
- "A confession" — for vulnerability/credibility
- "The key move" — for tactical tips
- Untitled — when content speaks for itself

**Avoid:** Generic titles like "Important!" or "Note:"

### BeforeAfter

```mdx
<BeforeAfter 
  before="2+ hours drafting individual responses"
  after="15-20 minutes reviewing AI drafts"
  context="Optional explanatory line"
/>
```

**Use when:** Showing transformation, time savings, mindset shifts. Contrast must be concrete.

### TimeSaved

```mdx
<TimeSaved hours={10} task="administrative work" frequency="per week" />
```

**Use when:** You have real data. Specificity builds trust.

### RelatedPost

```mdx
<RelatedPost 
  slug="post-slug" 
  title="The Full Post Title"
  context="Why this connects → "
/>
```

**Use when:** Genuine "read next" connection exists.

### CallToAction

```mdx
<CallToAction text="Want help with X?" link="/booking" />
```

**Use:** Once per post, at the end. Never mid-article.

---

## Visual Cadence

Insert a visual element every 300-500 words. **Do not just label the visual; provide the Visual Spec so it can be created.**

### Visual Spec Examples

**For Charts:**
```
[VISUAL SPEC: Bar chart comparing AI adoption rates (2024) vs (2025). 
Data points: Students=66%→92%, Teachers=41%→53%. 
Caption: "The gap between student and teacher adoption is widening."]
```

**For Diagrams:**
```
[VISUAL SPEC: Mermaid.js flow chart showing the loop between 
Draft → AI Review → Human Edit → Final. Use arrows to show iteration.]
```

**For Images:**
```
[VISUAL SPEC: Midjourney Prompt: A minimalist, isometric illustration 
of a messy desk becoming organized, blue and white palette, clean lines.]
```

**For Screenshots:**
```
[VISUAL SPEC: Screenshot of Claude's interface showing the 
"Projects" feature, with the sidebar highlighted and a sample 
project named "Parent Communication Templates" visible.]
```

Mark these in your outline: `[VISUAL SPEC: description]`

---

## SEO & GEO Optimization

Content must be optimized for two discovery channels: traditional search (SEO) and AI-powered answers (GEO).

### SEO Fundamentals

**Structure:**
- Clear H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy
- Primary keyword in title, first 100 words, and 1-2 H2s
- Meta description: 150-160 characters, compelling, includes keyword
- Internal links to 2-3 related posts (using descriptive anchor text, not just "click here")
- Short, descriptive URL slugs

**E-E-A-T Signals:**
- **Experience** — Personal examples from your work
- **Expertise** — Deep understanding, not surface summaries
- **Authoritativeness** — Consistent coverage, quality sources
- **Trustworthiness** — Accurate citations, transparent attribution

### GEO: Generative Engine Optimization

GEO optimizes content to be cited by AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overviews).

#### Platform-Specific Nuances

| Platform | Preferences |
|----------|-------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Encyclopedic content. Loves Wikipedia-style comprehensiveness and "definitive" guides. Authority matters heavily. |
| **Perplexity** | Rewards recency and community examples. Values "fresh" data (2024/2025) over general principles. |
| **Google AI Overviews** | Prioritizes existing top-ranking content. Strong SEO = better AI Overview presence. |
| **Claude** | Values nuanced, well-reasoned content with clear structure. Less likely to hallucinate if logic is sound. |

#### Core Principles

**1. Answer-First Structure**

Put the direct answer in the first 40-60 words:

```markdown
❌ "Many people wonder about the best way to handle AI in schools..."

✓ "Schools implementing assessment redesign see 40% fewer AI-related 
   integrity issues. The shift from catching cheaters to designing 
   better assignments is working."
```

**2. Fact Density**

Include specific statistics every 150-200 words. AI loves citing numbers.

**3. Quotable Statements**

Write clear, declarative sentences AI can lift directly:

```markdown
❌ "It's worth considering that detection might not be effective..."
✓ "Detection tools are unreliable—94% of AI-generated work goes undetected."
```

**4. Structured for Extraction**

- Question-based headings that match how people prompt AI
- Tables for comparisons
- Numbered lists for processes
- One idea per paragraph

**5. Source Transparency**

Cite explicitly. AI rewards transparent attribution:

```markdown
❌ "Research shows that..."
✓ "According to RAND's 2025 study, 54% of students now use AI for school."
```

### The FAQ Pattern (Highest GEO Performance)

Add FAQ section to pillar content:

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### [Exact question someone would ask AI]

[Direct 2-4 sentence answer with specific data]

### [Another natural question]

[Direct answer, no hedging]
```

---

## The Tactical Setup

Before outlining, answer these questions:

1. **What's the specific pain point?** (Not "AI in schools" — that's too vague. "Teachers making daily decisions about AI without any guidance" is specific.)

2. **What are the 2-4 tactical takeaways?** (What will they DO differently after reading?)

3. **What's your unique angle?** (Why should they read YOUR take?)

4. **What evidence do you have?** (Data, case studies, personal experience)

5. **What personal moments can you include?** (Confessions, mistakes, realizations, shifts)

### The Pre-Mortem (Strategy Check)

Before you start writing, ask:

- **Why might a reader ignore this?** (Be honest about the competition for attention)
- **Is the 'pain point' actually a minor annoyance?** (If it's not keeping them up at night, reconsider)
- **Have 10 other people already written this exact headline?** (If yes, how is yours different? What's your unique angle or data?)

If you can't answer these convincingly, refine the concept before drafting.

---

## Repurposing Protocol (Atomization)

When a piece of content is complete, generate these distribution assets:

### 1. The LinkedIn Carousel Script

Extract the 5 distinct "shifts" or "steps" into a slide-by-slide script:

```
Slide 1: The Hook/Problem
  - [One punchy statement that stops the scroll]
  
Slide 2-6: The Steps/Insights
  - Slide 2: [First key point — bold claim + one supporting sentence]
  - Slide 3: [Second key point]
  - Slide 4: [Third key point]
  - Slide 5: [Fourth key point]
  - Slide 6: [Fifth key point or the "so what"]
  
Slide 7: The Summary & CTA
  - [Recap the transformation]
  - [Clear call to action: comment, follow, link in bio]
```

### 2. The "Spiky Point of View" Post

Take the most contrarian "Warning" callout or "Quotable Statement" and turn it into a 200-word text-only LinkedIn/X post:

```
[Contrarian opening line — the thing most people get wrong]

[2-3 sentences explaining why the conventional wisdom fails]

[Your alternative take — specific and actionable]

[One line of proof — stat, example, or personal experience]

[Closing question or CTA that invites engagement]
```

### 3. The Newsletter Tease

A 150-word "Hook + Link" summary for email distribution:

```
[Problem statement — 1-2 sentences that name the pain]

[Promise — what they'll learn or be able to do]

[One surprising stat or insight from the post]

[CTA: "Read the full breakdown here: [link]"]
```

## Quick Commands

**Start a new piece:**
```
Help me outline a post about [topic]. The specific problem I'm solving is [pain point]. 
My unique angle is [what only I can say]. Here are some personal experiences I can include: [list].
Run the Pre-Mortem on this topic before we start.
```

**Get section feedback:**
```
Review this section. Check for: AI-sounding phrases, missing inline citations, 
opportunities for personal narrative, and vague claims that need specifics.
```

**Improve a hook:**
```
This hook is weak: [paste]. Give me 3 alternatives that start with a specific 
moment rather than a thesis statement.
```

**Anti-slop check:**
```
Scan this draft for AI-sounding patterns and flag anything that needs to be more human.
```

**Citation check:**
```
Review this draft for citation quality. Flag any "research shows" or "studies indicate" 
that need specific sources. Check that all stats are bolded and sources are hyperlinked inline.
```

**Final polish:**
```
Run the final checklist on this draft. Be ruthless about citation format, 
personal narrative presence, and anti-slop patterns.
```

**SEO/GEO optimization:**
```
Optimize this draft for search and AI citation. Check: answer in first 50 words, 
statistics with sources, quotable statements, question-based headings. Suggest FAQ questions.
```

**Repurpose:**
```
The post is done. Generate the LinkedIn Carousel script, the Spiky Point of View 
text post, and the Newsletter Tease for distribution.
```
